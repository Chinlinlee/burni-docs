# FHIR Validator
Burni's FHIR Validator is implemented through the integration of Node.js and Java from the project [node-java-fhir-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-java-fhir-validator).

!!! warning "Important Note"
    Please use version 0.2.0 of [node-java-fhir-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-java-fhir-validator). Subsequent versions have not been integrated into Burni yet.

    - Version 0.2.0 of node-java-fhir-validator uses [joeferner / node-java](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java).
    - Subsequent versions use [node-java-bridge](https://github.com/MarkusJx/node-java-bridge) to replicate the functionality of [fhir-validator-wrapper](https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper).


- The path where Burni places the FHIR Validator: `utils/validator`
    - `index.js`: Initializes and imports StructureDefinition (profile json file) and xxx.package.tgz (ig tgz file) from the `utils/validator/igs` folder into the validator code.
    - `processor.js`: Implements the code for `validateResource`.

## Which APIs use the FHIR Validator?
- create: When POSTing data, validation is performed first. If validation passes, then create operation is executed; otherwise, a 422 error is returned.
- update: When PUTting data, validation is performed first. If validation passes, then update operation is executed; otherwise, a 422 error is returned.
- $validate: Validation function that returns a 200 response if successful; otherwise, a 422 error is returned.
